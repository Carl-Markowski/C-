# C-

This repository holds code that I have completed so far in my various C and C++ classes at UCCS. 

The files using the naming standard "MarkowskiCarlHWXX" are homework assignments completed in CS 2060 (C). They use concepts varying from simple control structures to Linked List.

"MarkowskiCarlIteration01" and "MarkowskiCarlIteration02" are the different iterations used for my final project for CS 2060. These two programs use every concept we discussed throughout the semester.

The files using the naming standard "Markowski-X.X" are homework assignments completed in CS3060 (C++). As of (02/15/2023)
